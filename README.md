## Project design

## About the project
The user logs in or registers on the site and they have the game available.

There are several types of ants, and the user initially has either one type of ant or several. It is possible to buy ants. Initially the price is 0, but then it increases. These ants he can send on a journey. After a certain time, the ants come and bring various items. These items can be sold on the “exchange”, which is updated every day. Accordingly, the user may or may not sell the item profitably. Having accumulated enough ants, he can attack the boss. This he needs to get a chest from him, which can be opened by waiting for the opening time. A random type of ant will fall out of the chest. If the user already has this type of ant, there are 1 more ant of this type. 

The main goal of the players is the competitive process, as the leaderboard is displayed on this page. The best players are those who have the most ants.

This is the base we want to have time to implement. If we have time left, we will try to increase the complexity of the project even more.

## Progress Tracking Board
We use the <a href="https://trello.com/b/vsnNsZNu/antfarm">Trello</a> board to roughly approximate how our project will work, as well as for diffing tasks.
